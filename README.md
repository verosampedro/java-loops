# Java Loops

## What did the exercise consist of?

Create a program that, given an integer, n, prints its multiplication table (from 1 to 10). (Terminal output is not necessary)
Each multiple n * i (where 1 <= i => 10) must be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result (multiplication table).

Example: given n = 5

Output:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50

Requirement:
Must be tested. At least one test of the method that returns the array.
